You may also use a Lube-n-Walk kit that can be purchased through both aforementioned sellers. You need to use 2-3 ounces of lubrication each application. The belt & deck come pre-lubricated and subsequent lubrication should be performed every 90 hours of use, or every 90 days, regardless of usage as it can dry out. You will want to periodically check to make sure the deck is not dry.<\/p><p>Do not lubricate with anything other than 100% Silicone lubricant for treadmills. (DO NOT USE SILICONE CAULKING FOR BATHROOM AND KITCHEN PROJECTS OR A LUBRICANT THAT HAS A SPRAY\/FOAM BASE)<\/p><p>Keeping the deck lubricated at the recommended intervals ensures the longest life possible for your treadmill. If the lubricant dries out, the friction between the belt and deck rises and places undue stress on the drive motor, drive belt and electronic motor control board, which could result in catastrophic failure of these expensive components. Failure to lubricate the deck at<\/p><p>regular intervals may void the warranty.<\/p><p>Use the following procedure to apply the silicone lubricant:<\/p><p>1. Turn the power switch off and unplug the power cord from the wall outlet.<\/p><p>2. Measure 18\" from the edge of the motor cover; kneel down and reach under the belt approximately 4- 6” from one edge. Squirt a line of lubricant about 1\/8” wide x 15\" long in an “S” pattern perpendicular to the motor cover.<\/p><p>3. Repeat the process on the opposite side.<\/p><p>4. Plug the electrical cord back into the outlet and turn the power switch on.<\/p><p>5. Walk on the belt at a moderate speed for five minutes to evenly distribute the silicone lube.<\/p><p>*This applies to all Sole treadmills with the exception of the TT8. The TT8 model has a wax coating that is infused into the deck. It generally withstands up to 20,000 miles of use on the original side. It can then be flipped to the other side. As it wears down the user can reapply paraffin wax.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["cff91a67-fd38-45b5-aadf-18532b460ecf","4f69c805-761b-4c5d-ac16-de1c9bc66498","0afbe483-3a59-42f9-bac6-5b426ffa850c"],"disabled":true,"settings":{"full_width":false,"content_width":"large","text_position":"start","background":"","background_gradient":"","text_color":""}}},"order":["main","dd1c6ea1-d5cd-427e-863a-c6b2a161d5c0","c5f73c28-e20e-44b1-b412-a99c4ba10929","33c47f1c-fee9-4d25-99b0-01fe05b69543","8e88dfe0-b3cd-441b-bcaa-f8e835e5160a","d211fbfb-39e6-4be2-b604-5f12278969af","1ee66e9b-9b13-4a92-a3cd-3b17c5e43c70","d9086560-6321-406b-a000-fcc7bfb1b428","a765b0ab-8468-45ff-9af4-9826287a8265","6e37221e-2fca-48d0-9a39-e4dc052e6944","773946a9-bcd6-406c-929a-c17ab0792f5c","69567c0a-d808-446f-a746-739c6a9ea44e"]}
